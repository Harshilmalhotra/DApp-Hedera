## What we learned

### What is Hedera?
<a href="https://hedera.com/" style="color: #9c07b6">Hedera</a> is a decentralized, open-source, proof-of-stake public ledger that utilizes the leaderless, asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT) hashgraph consensus algorithm. It is governed by a collusion-resistant, decentralized council of leading enterprises, universities, and web3 projects from around the world.

### What is Django?
<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" style="color: #9c07b6">Django</a> is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.

### What is Docker?
<a href="https://www.docker.com/" style="color: #9c07b6">Docker</a> takes away repetitive, mundane configuration tasks and is used throughout the development lifecycle for fast, easy and portable application development – desktop and cloud. Docker’s comprehensive end to end platform includes UIs, CLIs, APIs and security that are engineered to work together across the entire application delivery lifecycle.

### What is Carbon Components Svelte?
<a href="https://www.docker.com/" style="color: #9c07b6">Carbon Components Svelte</a> is a Svelte component library that implements the Carbon Design System, an open source design system by IBM. Design systems facilitate design and development through reuse, consistency, and extensibility.
